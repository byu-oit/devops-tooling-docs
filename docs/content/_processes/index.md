# DevOps Processes

## Application Engineering

The Application Engineering department (formerly Development Operations Department) in BYU's Office of IT is lead by 
Russ Scadden. His plan for the department can be found 
[in Box](https://byu.app.box.com/notes/368316942875?s=58hgrl3ze8fxjffzw8zeenpegntln1bq).

## DevOps Tools, Development Platforms, and DX

The BYU Apps Custom team in the Application Engineering department have been tasked with the maintenance and support of 
deployment tools, developer experience (DX), and develop platforms. Those services in the Office of IT will be managed 
by Paul Eden. Though the services will be supported by the custom team, other developers are welcome and encouraged to 
contribute to and support these tools.
