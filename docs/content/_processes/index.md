# DevOps Processes

## Application Engineering

The Application Engineering department in BYU's Office of IT is lead by Russ Scadden.

## Developer Experience (DX)

The DevX Team is a group of individuals compiled from different teams from OIT working together on the best practices of using DevOps at BYU. This team works in all things relating to Developer Experience, including the maintenance and support of deployment tools (CI/CD) and development stacks. Those services in the Office of IT will be directed 
by Dan Cunningham. Though the services will be supported by the DevX team, other developers are welcome and encouraged to engage, contribute to, and support these tools.

Development stack definitions and best practices can be found [here](https://github.com/byu-oit/ces-dev-best-practices).
